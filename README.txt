- Important notes -

To see the webpage, please open the "index.html" file.

It is best to view the webpage while connected to the internet as some html
elements may be linked to some online assets (SVG icons for example). 

This webpage is first made on a 1920x1080 desktop resolution so I advised to view it
in the same resolution first. 

Responsiveness has been specifically applied to the following screen sizes using media 
queries: 1280px(xl), 1024px(lg), 768px(md), 640px(sm), 476px(xs).

I wasn't sure if there was a mobile view toggle in Figma so please be aware that I decided
to design the website's smaller res versions by my own.

- Additional notes -

I was initially planning on making the webpage using bootstrap but I 
immediately got uncomfortable with it due to a long time of not using it. I decided
that I can replicate the webpage more accurately by using vanilla custom CSS codes. 

I am well aware that I havent been able to properly replicate a few properties from the 
original webpage such as the dropdown lists, the carousel on the Teams Section and some 
label styles on the form section. I admit that this is still due to my current unfamiliarity 
with the concepts of more advance styling.
